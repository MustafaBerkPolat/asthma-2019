# Socioeconomic and Environmental Determinants of Asthma ER Visits and Hospitalizations (U.S. Counties, 2019)

## Overview

Asthma is a chronic respiratory tract condition that is classified as ambulatory case sensitive. 
This designation indicates that the vast majority of asthma-related hospitalizations and ER visits are preventable through timely and effective outpatient care.
Despite the availability of effective treatments, preventable hospitalizations persist, serving as a proxy for failures in outpatient management. The severity of the condition is exacerbated by upstream determinants such as poverty, environmental quality, and healthcare accessibility, transforming a manageable chronic condition into an acute medical emergency.
This research project serves to investigate the connections between socioeconomic status, environment and housing, access to care and how these factors play into asthma-related ER and hospitalization rates.

## Data Used

Information from several government agencies and non-profit organizations have been used during this project:
 - [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs.html)"s 5 year estimate private and public health insurance coverage and estimate population by age, gender and dependency per county 
(codes ACSST5Y2019.S2703, ACSST5Y2019.S2704 and ACSST5Y2019.S0101)
 - [Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)](https://www.epa.gov/)"s national-scale air toxic assesments (051646 on the [EPH](https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/DataExplorer/?c=11&i=81&m=-1) system)
 - [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/index.html)"s age-adjusted ER visits and hospitalizations for asthma per 10,000 population (051823 and 053054 respectively on the EPH system)
 - [HRSA Data Warehouse](https://data.hrsa.gov/topics/health-workforce/nchwa/ahrf)"s active medical doctor and respiratory therapist estimations per state, from AMA Physician Professional Data 2019
 - [County Health Rankings & Roadmaps](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/reports/2019-county-health-rankings-key-findings-report)" 2019 County Health Rankings dataset"s "Ranked Measure Data" and "Additional Measure Data" tabs
 - [Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR)](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/place-health/index.html)"s CDC Social Vulnerability Index for 2018
 - [United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.2020.html#list-tab-790442341)"s shapefiles for county border shape and location information.
Additional datasets were cleaned in the initial steps but left out during the analysis due to redundancy.

## Key Findings

 - Spatial filters dominate the Lasso selections, showing that asthma hospitalizations and ER visit rates are driven by a complex combination of factors and cannot be explained by singular measurements or their simple interactions
 - The strong performance of the "hard cutoff" logic suggests that future spatial epidemiological work must move beyond "blind" spatial smoothing and incorporate political geography into the definition of spatial weights. Diseases may not respect borders, but healthcare access certainly does.
 - Asthma morbidity in the United States is a syndemic phenomenon driven neither by biology alone, nor by pollution alone, evident from the presence of several interaction terms between pollution terms and socioeconomic factors in the upper side of the results tables for both targets.


## Methodology

### Data Cleaning and Merging

The different datasets used in this project follow different formatting schemes, so the first step was to clean the data and standardize the format. All the datasets" names were initially manually parsed and renamed for clarity, then loaded into a dictionary of Polars dataframes in Python for the processing. The used datasets as they were downloaded and the names given to them are as follows:
 - 2025_Gaz_counties_national -> "lat_long", to serve as the geographical position data for the imputing of missing measurements later on
 - 5 Year estimate population by age, gender and dependency per county (ACSST5Y2019.S0101) -> "5yr_demographic", for detailed population estimates
 - 5 Year estimate public health insurance coverage (ACSST5Y2019.S2704) ->"5yr_public_insurance", for public insurance coverage data
 - 5 Year estimate private health insurance coverage (ACSST5Y2019.S2703) -> "5yr_private_insurance", for private insurance coverage data
(the 5-year estimates were used for the above 3 measures to improve reliability and coverage for small/urban counties)
 - Pollutant per county (_051646) -> "pollution", to track the micrograms of air pollutants per cubic meter
 - Asthma hospitalizations (_053054) -> "asthma_hospitalization"
 - Emergency asthma visits (_051823) -> "emergency_asthma"
The emergency asthma visit and asthma hospitalization dataframes were combined into one before saving
 - "Medical doctors per state" and "Respiratory therapists per state" -> "md_per_state" and "resp_therapist_per_state"
 - 2019 County Health Rankings Data - v3 -> two separate dataframes; "county_health_measures" to store directly health-related data like infant mortality rates and HIV prevalence, and "county_additional_measures" to store other information like homicides and disconnected youth. These dataframes went through an additional step of cleaning afterwards since they included overlapping information
 - SVI 2018 -> "svi_2018"

Due to a lack of FIPS columns in some of the datasets, county names had to be used to ensure conpatibility, and had to undergo a long series of standardization steps. All the state and county name columns were normalized into "State" and "County" respectively, with the capitalization set to title case, and any trailing phrases like " County", " Parish" and " Borough" were standardized into " County" for unification purposes. A general-purpose function was defined to catch the "duplicate" county entries for Virgninian independent cities to ensure that they were appropriately suffixed with " City" when referring to independent cities and " County" otherwise, to ensure that upon merging the datasets the available information was appropriately assigned to the correct census units. To avoid issues with duplicate county names like "Orange County", another column was created to host the combined "County (State)" name. Several of these datasets utilized code phrases as the headers for the columns, and these headers had to be re-assigned using the tables included either along the datasets themselves or the dictionary tables stored in the supplementary documentation by extracting them via pdfplumber. The processed dataframes were then saved to disk for the analysis step


### Statistical Analysis

Since our target features were limited to the continental US, all data for Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico counties were dropped before progressing to avoid islands causing issues for contiguity calculations. For the analysis to have spatial context, the pygris package was utilized to append county border data in the form of a shapefile directliy inside Python. These borders were used to calculate two separate sets of weight matrices; one "master" matrix generated using the full continental US and a "constrained" matrix treating each state as a separate island to be used for calculations related to features that are impacted by state-level differences in policy implementation, such as insurance. From the generated spatial filtering eigenvectors, those with a Moran"s I higher than 0.25 were selected to be used for the analysis.

A "hard cutoff list" was defined from features that had keywords such as "insurance" and "education" to differentiate them from smooth features for the purposes of calculating spatial lags and the imputation of missing entries. Features were then filtered based on their coverage of counties with data for our target features separately to ensure that a feature that provides valuable context to the statistical models for one target feature but noise to the other did not affect the second target feature and vice-versa. To accomplish this, two lists containing the names of the features were created to use as filters for the Lasso step.

Moran"s I values for features with over 95% completedness were calculated to identify potential candidates for spatial lagging, identifying 234 features to generate spatial lags for. When calculating the Moran"s I values, features in the hard cutoff list used the constrained weights while "smooth" features like air pollution used the full weights matrix. To ensure the logic was consistent between base and lagged features, the hard cutoff list was expanded to contain the lagged hard cutoff features. Of the initial 52 hard cutoff features, 49 were identified as complete and spatially clustered enough to generate lagged features from. The spatial lags were calculated prior to imputation to provide added context for the imputation algorithm.

Imputation was done in three passes, where the smooth features were imputed using a random forest regressor, then the spatial lags were recalculated for these now complete features. In the second pass, features in the hard cutoff list were imputed on a state basis, fragmenting the dataframe into one individual dataframe for each state to ensure other states" counties did not affect the algorithm. Counties with less than 5 in-state neighbors were deemed to not have enough context to be imputed this way, and in the final pass these counties were imputed using the full country data for context.

Interaction terms were then generated from the fully imputed dataframe, mostly for terms in other categories such as "transportation" or "housing" paired with "pollution" data, and the full details of these feature pairs can be seen in the analysis notebook. A helper function was defined to expand the feature filter lists created for each of the target features to ensure that the prediction step did not include interaction terms between the target feature being predicted and another feature.

In the final step, a Lasso cross validation model was used to select statistically significant features for each of the target features, and then ordinary least squares scores and variance inflation factors were calculated to interpret the results. Below tables feature the features selected by Lasso with a VIF score <10 and p-value <0.05, and are ordered in descending absolute OLS score.

While robust, this analysis is subject to the ecological fallacy. Relationships observed at the county level (e.g., between unemployment and asthma) do not necessarily hold for individuals. We cannot definitively say that the specific unemployed individuals are the ones visiting the ER, only that communities with high unemployment have higher rates.

Furthermore, the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) remains a challenge. While the "hard border" strategy successfully addressed state-level policy discontinuities, the aggregation of data to the county level inherently smoothes over intra-county disparities. A wealthy county may have a "cancer alley" neighborhood within it that is masked by the county-wide average. Future research should aim for census-tract level analysis to better capture these hyper-local environmental justice issues.
